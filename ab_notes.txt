Notes on AdaBoostClassifier Experimentation

---

Goal:
	Achieve the highest 10-fold cross validation accuracy score over all examples.

Optimal Values:
	max_depth = 1 (decision stumps)
	n_estimators = 49
	learning_rate = 0.1681744

Method:
	(Similar for all classifiers...)  Loop over large range of values using multiple nested loops to test variable combinations simultaneously and gradually converge the bounds of each loop with smaller step values centered on the optimal values of each iteration.  Eventually stop (I stopped at six figures for learning_rate).
