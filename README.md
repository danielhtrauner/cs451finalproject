cs451finalproject TODO List:  
=================  

(proposal moved to proposal.txt)  

High Priority:  
--------------
[x] Set up separate files to begin experimenting with various classifiers (11/23/13)  
[x] Tweak parameters for RandomForestClassifier to obtain an optimal result (11/30/13)  
[x] Tweak parameters for LinearSVC to obtain an optimal result (11/30/13)  
[x] Tweak parameters for KNeighborsClassifier to obtain an optimal result (11/29/13)  
[x] Tweak parameters for AdaBoostClassifier to obtain an optimal result (11/25/13)  

[x] Compare results of various experiments (ttest) (12/2/13)  

[x] Make 2-3 PPT slides and prepare for in-class Friday presentation  

[x] Write formal final write up  

Medium Priority:  
----------------
[x] Set up a multi-class problem and any required files (12/2/13)  

[x] Tweak parameters for the multi-class classifier(s) to obtain an optimal result (12/2/13)  

[x] Write about the results (add to formal write up)  

Low Priority:  
-------------  
[ ] Figure out an efficient way to build a model that can be hosted online  

[ ] Make a basic website where one can (1) enter their information and get classified and (2) display information about the final algorithm used  

Super Low Priority:  
-------------------
[ ] Figure out an interesting way to make users' input contribute to the data (i.e. online learning)
