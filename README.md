=================

(proposal moved to proposal.txt)

High Priority:
--------------
[x] Set up separate files to begin experimenting with various classifiers (11/23/13)  
[x] Tweak parameters for RandomForestClassifier to obtain an optimal result (11/30/13)   
[x] Tweak parameters for LinearSVC to obtain an optimal result (11/30/13)   
[x] Tweak parameters for KNeighborsClassifier to obtain an optimal result (11/29/13)  
[x] Tweak parameters for AdaBoostClassifier to obtain an optimal result (11/25/13)  
[ ] Compare results of various experiments (ttest) and write about which classifier is best for the binary admission/enrollment problem  
[ ] Write formal final write up  

Medium Priority:
----------------
[ ] Set up a multi-class problem and any required files  
[ ] Tweak parameters for the multi-class classifier(s) to obtain an optimal result  
[ ] Write about the results (formal write up)  

Low Priority:  
-------------  
[ ] Figure out an efficient way to build a model that can be hosted online  
[ ] Make a basic website where one can (1) enter their information and get classified and (2) display information about the final algorithm used  
[ ] Figure out an interesting way to make users' input contribute to the data (i.e. online learning)
