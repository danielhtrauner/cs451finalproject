Notes on RandomForestClassifier Experimentation

---

Goal:
	Achieve the highest 10-fold cross validation accuracy score over all examples.

Optimal Values:
	n_estimators = 11
	max_depth = 4
	max_features = 2
	min_samples_split = 4
	min_samples_leaf = 4

Method:
	(Similar for all classifiers...)  Loop over large range of values using multiple nested loops to test variable combinations simultaneously and gradually converge the bounds of each loop with smaller step values centered on the optimal values of each iteration.  See testing code (left in for this one) for more details.

Result:
	10-Fold CV Accuracy: 0.686774059014 +/- 0.018149844248
